                MockOut is a mobile fantasy game for offseason events such as the NFL and NBA Drafts.
            </p>
            <p>
                I created Mockout with my partner in May of 2016, despite neither of us having experience in business or app development. By the NFL Draft in April of 2017, we had a basic NFL Draft game and had acquired almost 5,000 users.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, MockOut has games for the NFL and NBA Drafts, as well as NFL and NBA free agency, and has over 47,000 users.

            <p>
                I applied for the open "video editor" position in 2008 despite having no experience editing video. I was hired based only on my potential to teach myself how to edit on the job.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my time at DanceMedia, running the entire video department, I conceptualized, scheduled, shot, edited, audio mixed, provided motion graphics, and created original music for numerous series, including Behind the Curtain, Road to Nationals, Dance(212), and Choreography in Focus. In the 11 years I was employed at DanceMedia, I created hundreds of behind-the-scenes videos, sizzle reels, features, and more.
